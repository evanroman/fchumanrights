<h2>The Bill</h2>
<p>FCHumanRights hopes to use the <a href="http://www.fcgov.com/cityclerk/initiativegdlns.php">Citizen's Iniative</a> process to augment the current Federal genital mutilation law in the city of Fort Collins. As of april 2013, FCHumanRights is focusing on building local, community support.</p>
<p>To be added to the Fort Collin's City Code, Chapter 17, Section V &quot;OFFENSES INVOLVING CHILDREN:&quot;</p>
<h3>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or any part of the genitals of another person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</h3>
<h3>(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this section if the operation is (1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed, and is performed by a person licensed in the place of its performance as a medical practitioner; or (2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth and is performed for medical purposes connected with that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in training to become such a practitioner or midwife.</h3>
<h3>(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to be performed of any belief on the part of that person, or any other person, that the operation is required as a matter of custom or ritual.</h3>
<p>The proposed ballot is nearly verbatim with the existing 1996 federal law regarding genital mutilation, except for some key differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;labia majora or labia minora or clitoris&quot; in &quot;(a)&quot; is replaced with &quot;genitals&quot; to include male and intersex individuals under 18 years of age.</li>
<li>Subsection &quot;(d)&quot; is removed due to the limits of a munincipal law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing &quot;labia majora or labia minora or clitoris&quot; to an all encompassing term will give protection to all individuals, regardless of sex.</p>
<h3>Full text of &quot; USC &#167; 116 - Female genital mutilation&quot; below:</h3>
<p>(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
<p>(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this section if the operation is (1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed, and is performed by a person licensed in the place of its performance as a medical practitioner; or (2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth and is performed for medical purposes connected with that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in training to become such a practitioner or midwife.</p>
<p>(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to be performed of any belief on the part of that person, or any other person, that the operation is required as a matter of custom or ritual.</p>
<p>(d) Whoever knowingly transports from the United States and its territories a person in foreign commerce for the purpose of conduct with regard to that person that would be a violation of subsection (a) if the conduct occurred within the United States, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
