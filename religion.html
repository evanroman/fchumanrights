				<h2>Religious Rites or Human Rights?</h2>
				<h3>Judaism</h3>
				<p>Though circumcision is considered a requirement in Judaism, the way circumcision has been practiced has changed dramatically since the time of Abraham. Originally circumcision was not the complete removal of the foreskin. Before 140 CE, The practice of removing the entire foreskin was not practiced by Jews. During sometime around 140 CE, the practice of &quot;Pariah&quot; circumcision began to prevent Jews from passing as non-Jews in Greek culutre. The Torah forbid ritual amputation or marking and teaches human's are made in G*d's image.</p>
				<p>From the Torah, transcribed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton">tetragrammaton</a>:</p>
				<p>&quot;And G*d prepareth the man in His image; in the image of G*d He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them.&quot;(Genesis 1:27 Young's Literal Translation)</p>
				<p>&quot;And a cutting for the soul ye do not put in your flesh; and a writing, a cross-mark, ye do not put on you; I am J*H*V*H.&quot;(Leviticus 19:28 Young's Literal Translation)</p>
				<p>&quot;One wounded, bruised, or cut in the member doth not enter into the assembly of J*H*V*H;&quot;(Deuteronomy 23:1 Young's Literal Translation)</p>
				<p>The practice of &quot;Pariah&quot; circumcision consists of the following:</p>
				<p>&quot;its radical tearing off the lining of the prepuce of the glans and, with a sharpened fingernail or thumbnail, the removal of all the mucous tissue that comprises the inner lining of the prepuce and amputation of the whole prepuce made it impossible for a man thus circumcised to re-cover his glans, since there was insufficient penile skin left. It is this form which has been used since then by Jews and is the model for the modern non-ritual circumcision which also involves radical amputation after the forcible breaking-down of the synechia between prepuce and glans penis&quot;(<a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/price-uklc/#jew">Male Circumcision: A Legal Affront</a>)</p>

				<p>Moses Maimondes, a distinguished Sephardim Rabbi of the middle ages wrote:</p>
				<p>&quot;As regards circumcision, I think that one of its objects is to limit sexual intercourse, and to weaken the organ of generation as far as possible, and thus cause man to be moderate. Some people believe that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's formation; but every one can easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient so as to require external completion, especially as the use of the fore-skin to that organ is evident? This commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient physical creation, but as a means for perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The bodily injury caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment; the organ necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is deprived of its covering from the beginning. Our Sages (Beresh. Rabba, c. 80) say distinctly: It is hard for a woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse, to separate from him. This is, as I believe, the best reason for the commandment concerning circumcision. And who was the first to perform this commandment? Abraham, our father! of whom it is well known how he feared sin; it is described by our Sages in reference to the words, `Behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon' (Gen. xii.II).</p>
				<p>This law can only be kept and perpetuated in its perfection, if circumcision is performed when the child is very young, and this for three good reasons. First, if the operation were postponed till the boy had grown up, he would perhaps not submit to it. Secondly, the young child has not much pain, because the skin is tender, and the imagination weak; for grown-up persons are in dread and fear of things which they imagine as coming, some time before these actually occur. Thirdly, when a child is very young, the parents do not think much of him; because the image of the child, that leads the parents to love him, has not yet taken a firm root in their minds. That image becomes stronger by the continual sight; it grows with the development of the child, and later on the image begins again to decrease and to vanish. The parents' love for a new-born child is not as great as it is when the child is one year old. The feeling and love of the father for the child would have led him to neglect the law if he were allowed to wait two or three years, whilst shortly after birth the image is very weak in the mind of the parent, especially of the father who is responsible for the execution of this commandment. The circumcision must take place on the eighth day (Lev. xii. 3), because all living beings are after birth, within the first seven days, very weak and exceedingly tender, as if they were still in the womb of their mother; not until the eighth day can they be counted among those that enjoy the light of the world. That this is also the case with beasts may be inferred from the words of Scripture: `Seven days shall it be under the dam' (Lev. xxii. 27), as if it had no vitality before the end of that period. In the same manner man is circumcised after the completion of seven days. The period has been fixed, and has not been left to everybody's judgement.&quot;(<a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/">THE GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED by Moses Maimonides</a>)</p>
				<p>Under the proposed law, ritual bloodletting of minors will still be allowed, as long as there is no amputation. The importance of blood letting is a central part of Brit Milah. Traditionally, if a person who is circumcised wishes to convert to Judaism, they must undergo Hatafat Dam Brit. In Hatafat Dam Brit, blood is drawn from the circumcision scar.</p>

				<h3>Christianity</h3>
				<p>In Christianity, Jesus and his disciples make it clear that circumcision is no longer a requirement from G*d.</p>
				<p>&quot;for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.&quot;(Galations 5:6 Young's Literal Translation)</p>

				<h3>Islam</h3>
				<p>The Qur'an does not mention circumcision, but male and female circumcision is some islamic communities. The practice of female circumcision is far less prevalent than male circumcision in islamic communities. The Qur'an speaks against body modification.</p>
				<p>&quot;And He designed you, and has perfected your design. &quot; (Qur'an 40:64)</p>

				<h3>Regardless of any faith or religion, everyone deserves protection from body modification without their consent.</h3>
